Description of the user:
My tamagotchi user is a person looking to check in on my coding progress or a lover of 80's culture that wants to relive the glory days!! Take a minute to enjoy an old favorite and try your hand at keeping your pet happy and having fun!

List of features:
This app is growing but already has a colorful screen and a super adorable pet image that focuses your attention on the four quadrant interactive screen. Each quadrant has a different part of the pets life to control. Sleeping, Eating, Playing, and Defending yourself!! Two buttons on each quadrant control the actions and furture of your pet.
